I wanted to learn React and GraphQL so I decided to build my personal website using Gatsby and deploy with Firebase. Everything you see here was learned on the fly. The most challenging part so far was add the tag filters at the bottom. It turns out I didn't need any routing to accomplish it. Gatsby has a Link component making it easy to navigate to a dynamically created page.
