Welcome to my humble site! Feel free to poke around. Looks like you've found my first easter egg. Keep poking and I'm sure you'll find more (hint: my dog's name is Kludge). If you have any questions or find any bugs, feel free to reach out to me. I probably won't get to it. But I might. Who knows? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
